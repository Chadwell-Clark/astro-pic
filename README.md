# APOD-API

Simple Fetch to get the Astronomy picture of the day from the NASA APOD api.
**Note** uses the DEMO_KEY for the api key so is very limited in calls that can be made to the API

Basic fetch call that returns data and is parsed into a simple HTML Representation that shows picture,
Title, copyright and date. This is then inserted into the DOM with a querySelector
